# VoteChain

> Empowering Democracy Anywhere

---

## 📝 Overview
VoteChain is a **decentralized voting application** designed to revolutionize the electoral process.  
By combining **blockchain** technology for security and **machine learning (ML)** for voter registration and verification, VoteChain enables **young voters (18+)** and **physically disabled individuals** to vote remotely — without needing to travel to polling booths or hometowns.

Our mission is to make elections **secure**, **transparent**, and **accessible** to all citizens.

## 💡 Inspiration
In the **2024 Indian General Elections**, around **332 million** eligible voters did **not** cast their votes.  
Many voters — especially **young students** living away from home and **persons with disabilities** — are often unable to participate due to outdated, location-based polling systems.

**Problems we noticed:**
- **Inefficiency:** Manual counting errors, delays, and expensive recounts.
- **Security Risks:** Vulnerabilities in paper ballots and centralized databases.
- **Accessibility Barriers:** Difficulty accessing polling booths for certain groups.

We believe **technology should empower democracy**, not limit it.  
Thus, **VoteChain** was born: a way to **vote securely from anywhere**.

## 🎯 Goals
- **Secure Elections:** Use blockchain to prevent vote tampering and fraud.
- **Remote Accessibility:** Enable citizens to vote without being physically present at polling booths.
- **Verifiable Results:** Ensure transparency, immutability, and auditability of votes.
- **Increase Voter Turnout:** Make voting easier and more accessible for students, remote workers, and persons with disabilities.
- **Efficient Voting:** Streamline the voting process and eliminate manual counting delays.
